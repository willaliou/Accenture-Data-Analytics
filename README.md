# Accenture-Data-Analytics
# Overview
Client Background: Social Buzz is a fast-growing social media organization and over the past 5 years, Social Buzz has reached over 500 million active users each month. They have scaled quicker than anticipated and need the help of an advisory firm to oversee their scaling process effectively.

Due to their rapid growth and the digital nature of their core product, the amount of data that they create, collect and must analyze is huge. Every day over 100,000 pieces of content, ranging from text, images, videos and GIFs are posted. All of this data is highly unstructured and requires extremely sophisticated and expensive technology to manage and maintain.

Up until this point, they have not relied on any third-party firms to help them get to where they are. However one of the main reasons why they are looking to at bringing in external expertise is because, they want to learn data best practices from a large corporation. Due to the nature of their business, they have a massive amount of data so they are keen on understanding how the worldâ€™s biggest companies manage the challenges of big data.

To start our engagement with Social Buzz, we are running a 3-month initial project in order to prove to them that we are the best firm to work with. They are expecting the following:

- An audit of their big data practices
- An analysis of their content categories that highlight the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity.

# Data Cleaning and Preparation
We need to ensure that the data is cleaned before the analysis to provide a high-quality analysis that has fewer errors. I used Excel to clean the datasets with the following steps:
- Removed rows with missing values
- Assigned the right data types to columns
- Removed unnecessary columns that are not needed in analysis
- Combined the datasets using VLOOKUP formula

# Tasks
Task 1: Project Understanding
In this task, the client company is introduced and talked about their business problem, project requirements, and introduced the team that we're going to work with. We are tested on our knowledge of the project task.

Task 2: Data Cleaning & Modeling
In this step, we are focused on gathering the requirements needed for the analysis, cleaning those data, and doing proper modeling of the data. The client wanted to figure out which of the content categories has the highest aggregated popularity. We are also tested on information about the data.

Task 3: Data Visualization & Storytelling 

Task 4: Present to the Client
We are tasked with bringing the data to life in this part of the project. We summarized what we did in the project from start to finish to put in a presentation to show our client.
