# Overview
Client Background: Social Buzz is a fast growing social media organization and over the past 5 years, Social Buzz has reached over 500 million active users each month. They have scaled quicker than anticipated and need the help of an advisory firm to oversee their scaling process effectively.

Due to their rapid growth and digital nature of their core product, the amount of data that they create, collect and must analyze is huge. Every day over 100,000 pieces of content, ranging from text, images, videos and GIFs are posted. All of this data is highly unstructured and requires extremely sophisticated and expensive technology to manage and maintain.

Up until this point, they have not relied on any third party firms to help them get to where they are. However one of the main reasons why they are looking to at bringing in external expertise is because, they want to learn data best practices from a large corporation. Due to the nature of their business, they have a massive amount of data so they are keen on understanding how the worldâ€™s biggest companies manage the challenges of big data.

To start our engagement with Social Buzz, we are running a 3 month initial project in order to prove to them that we are the best firm to work with. They are expecting the following:

- An audit of their big data practices
- An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity.
